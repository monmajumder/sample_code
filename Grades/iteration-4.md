Group 11

Very good iteration overview. Solid progress with ParseCloud and extending ParseObject.

Should add specific deployment instructions to the README. [-2]

Great organization of code into activities, logic and views directories. Interesting use of custom views. 

Note from Hari: Unless I am completely misunderstanding your code structure, the amount of testing that you do is *very* limited even for Iteration-4 levels. Your application is front-end heavy since you are using Parse as your backend; therefore I would expect to see a significant amount of testing going on in the Android frontend. While there are *some* tests, they don't offer much coverage and in many cases aren't even really tests. The Parse tests are also rather limited [-2]

Total: 96/100
