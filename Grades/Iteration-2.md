# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluators: Scott Smith (mailto:scott@cs.jhu.edu), Elana Stroud (mailto:estroud1@jhu.edu)**

## UML Class Diagram

Good.

## Javadocs

Good.

## Parse

You need to look into parse a bit more and figure out how to interface to it.  You do have some stuff mentioned in architecture (e.g. game state), but it would have been better to propose an exact list of classes to persist. Specifically look into subclassing ParseObjects and what that looks like with Android and the inheritance hierarchy.

*-4 points*

## GUIs

Your UIs are much improved and we will give you +6 points on iteration 1.

## Overall:

You are much improved from iteration 1.  Your project may be a bit light for five people since you are not writing a backend.  At this point it is not such a big issue but you may need to be adding some extended features.

**Grade: 96/100**
