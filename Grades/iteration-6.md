# Presentation

- Clear explanation of goal.

- Clear explanation of gameplay.

- Good positioning of presenters on stage.

- Clear explanation of your take on MVC.

- Good explanation of interesting parts of your code/design.

- Barely readable UML diagram (too much information, small point size).

- Code review of getters and setters was not interesting.


# Demo

- The demo ran smoothly, congratulations!

- We appreciate owning up to the problems with synchronization.

# UI quality

- The UI was mostly simple but was clean and well-organized.
- Great graphical display for round wins!
- Circle layout was also good.
- Individual player tokens were too small in that circle.

# Tests

- You didn't really ever get tests to function in a constructive way, for example the tests I see look mostly like getter/setter tests as opposed to gameplay flow tests.

# Code inspection

- You could have done a lot more code cleaning up as requested in the iteration 5 remarks; it looks like you ran out of time for it.

# Iteration planning

- You ran into trouble due to too-late integration but managed to (mostly) pull it off by the end.

# Project difficulty

- The app itself was an appropriate level of difficulty.
- You had difficult synchronization issues given that it is a five-person multiple-round game.  As mentioned in your iteration report you probably had the incorrect back-end for the application and that made things more difficult than it should have been.
- You did not get the app working robustly and some needed features were missing, but you did get the key bits working.
