# Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 9

**Evaluator: [Elana Stroud](mailto:estroud1@jhu.edu)**

## Positive Remarks:

* Very detailed description of how to play the game
* Features list was thorough
* The GUI sketches (the ones that there were) were well-designed


## Feedback:

### Use Cases

The use cases were missing some of the steps (like the "waiting votes" screen). A good way to think about this is to follow the features list directly and make sure each step is included from start to finish.

*(-8 Points)*

### Gui Sketches

The GUI sketches are missing some of the gameplay. The more sketches explaining more of the gameplay will make things clearer to understand. Also adding labels of what each GUI sketch does could be helpful

*(-10 Points)*

### Architecture

No backend was specified. We discussed what backend you would use, I think Parse would be a great option. Make sure to clarify for the next iteration.

*(-2 Points)*

### NOTE

You can resubmit your changes to iteration-1 along with iteration-2 to get points back.


 **Grade: 80/100**
