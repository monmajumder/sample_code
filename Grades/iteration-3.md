## Code 
The amount of code written is a little bit sparse. Try to really grind out some of the functionality code with the next iteration. This seems like it will be the most difficult part of the project. 

*(-2 Points)*

## Iteration Plan
Very well laid out iteration plan. Good work setting up Parse and communication between the server and the client. Also great organization into the three packages: views, logic and activities.

## Javadoc

The javadocs are thorough and well documented.

## Additional Notes

You might want to consider subclasses Parse objects to make object manipulation easier in the future. That is something you can google if youâ€™re interested.
