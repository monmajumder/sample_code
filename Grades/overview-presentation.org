* Background / Purpose

  Clearly explained and understandable.

* Architecture

  General structure of code at this point explained.

* Presentation organization

  - Properly taking turns.

  - Demo went smoothly.

* Things to improve

  - Too much text on the slides makes it hard to follow the presentation. Too
    small fonts both on slides and UI Sketches were hard to read.

    /(-2 points)/

  - One of the presenters was in front of the TV, blocking what the other
    presenter was trying to point.
